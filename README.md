## What is Go

Go is a quick-to-learn type-safe highly-performant compiled language. The downside is that abstractions are usually not possible making it hard to write a large software in Go.

## Installation

It is using default libraries. Assuming Go is installed on your machine, just open the folder with files and run ``` go run .```

If Go is not on your machine, follow: https://go.dev/doc/install
